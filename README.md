Aquarium water change device - control software for arduino controller 

This project uses an arduino to automate the monthly 25% water changes that you're supposed to do.  
There are sensors for sensing the tank water level and refilling with treated water when the tank gets low 
On a programmable schedule it will perform 
1. draining the tank to the 75% full water levle 
2. refilling the tank with treated water up to the 100% full water level 

THis project could be incorported with an alexa switch to do water changes on demand
